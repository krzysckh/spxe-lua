spxe-lua
--------

lua ffi bindings for https://github.com/LogicEu/spxe

usage:
  $ ./build.sh
  $ lua53 example.lua

see example.lua.

caveats:
  - This requires cffi for PUC-Rio lua.
  - spxeEnd is renamed to spxe.finish(), because 'end' is a keyword in lua.
  - keyboard and mouse functions are now less cool
